 * Assignments contain information about a user's progress on a particular [Subject], including their current state and timestamps for various progress milestones. Assignments are created when a user has passed all the components of the given [Subject] and the assignment is at or below their current level for the first time.

 * **Note:** The [unlockedAt], [startedAt], [passedAt], and [burnedAt] timestamps are always in sequential order â€” assignments can't be started before they're unlocked, passed before they're started, etc.
